vote-or-skip
============

This is a CGI script written in Python that was written for the Unix Tools course assignment. It uses a shell script that I wrote for another assignment for voting on items that belong to various categories using the Condorcet method. It is currently live at http://cs.nyu.edu/~ssb402/voteorskip.cgi
